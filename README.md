# Passive Radar| SDR | MATLAB | GNU RADIO

ORGANIZATION AND SEQUENCE: 

 1. LITERATURE- In this folder there is a document (.PWP) that contains the abstracts of Scientific Articles/Documents used for the investigation of the theme of the Master's
Dissertation, as well as the reference to the article used.

 2. GNU RADIO- For the first part of the project, it was necessary to install LimeSDR Drivers and libraries , such as Lime Suite, CubicSDR, GNU radio companion and Pothos Flow-
Initially it is necessary to use Lime suite in order to connect LimeSDR and callibrate Tx and Rx.
Next, it was used cubicSDR to evaluate the spectogram of FM signals.
In order to start programming SDR at a high level end, it was used Gnu radio companion and Pothos Flow:
     |Creating a FM receiver in both programs
     |Experiment of Passive Radar
     |Passive Radar using the LimeSDR

 3. MATLAB- In this folder there is the matlab code used.
